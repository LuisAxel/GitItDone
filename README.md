# GitItDone

This repository is a collection of my solutions to coding challenges from different platforms. Here, you'll find everything from elegant algorithms to convoluted logic, all in the name of improving my coding skills and having a bit of fun along the way.

## What's Inside? (Prepare to Be Amazed... or Confused)

- **Bug Hunts**: Elusive bugs hiding in plain sight making edge cases fail.
- **Ingenious Problem Solving**: Solutions that are as creative as they are effective, hopefully...
- **Aha! Moments**: Solutions that were born from pure coding epiphanies.
- **Mind-Bending Challenges**: Baffling problems that left me questioning my life choices.
